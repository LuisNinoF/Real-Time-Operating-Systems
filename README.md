# Real-Time-Operating-Systems

## Objective
Demonstrate the use of real-time operating systems (RTOS) concepts and FreeRTOS in embedded systems projects. This repository contains two projects:

P1 RTOS - shows a custom round robin scheduler with context switching between three threads using a linked list structure.

P2 FreeRTOS - shows a custom application built on FreeRTOS, including: interrupts, notifications, queues, semaphores and mutex.

### Skills Learned

- Round robin scheduling
- Context switching
- Inter-thread communication

### Tools Used
